# Advent of Code 2024

This repo is my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for 2024.

I am doing this each year in order to learn a new language in some depth, that I would not otherwise have the opportunity to learn. This year I am learning [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). My goal is to try and learn a bit of everything (project structure, testing, conventions, etc ...).

If you want to run the project, install the GHC compiler and related tools first. You can run each day with Cabal (i.e. `cabal run day1`).
